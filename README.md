# Financial Distress Prediction
I created this project for Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs offered by Jovian.ai. Under this project, I used two machine learning algorithms namely Decision Tree and Random Forest for predicting whether somebody will face financial distress in the near future, based on the past and present conditions.
